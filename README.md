## Welcome to django-pgfields

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lukesneeringer/django-pgfields.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lukesneeringer/django-pgfields) [![Coverage](https://coveralls.io/repos/lukesneeringer/django-pgfields/badge.png?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/lukesneeringer/django-pgfields)

The purpose of django-pgfields is to provide specialized Field subclasses
for data types available in PostgreSQL but not exposed in the Django ORM
(because of lack of availability in other database backends).

Full documentation is graciously hosted by [Read the Docs](https://django-pgfields.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).
